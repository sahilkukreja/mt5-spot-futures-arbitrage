## Standing constraints (from the project mandate)

- Experimental capital ceiling: USD 1,000. This is a hard ceiling, not proof of adequate margin.
- No martingale, grid averaging, loss-recovery sizing, or hidden directional exposure, ever.
- No new entries after kill-switch activation.
- 0.01 lot on both legs is a starting target, not an assumption of equal exposure — hedge ratio must be calculated.
